# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Plotting-of-Atmospheric-Pollutan
Time series analysis and generates plots for atmospheric pollutant data
This script performs time series analysis and generates plots for atmospheric pollutant data. It takes in a dataset containing pollutant concentrations and timestamps, applies time series techniques such as decomposition and forecasting, and produces visualizations of the pollutant trends over time. The resulting plots can help identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the pollutant data.
